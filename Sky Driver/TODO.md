* Fuel / Oxygen
* HUD
* Level select screen
* Text file to level conversion
* Collision "lip" between different platforms is awkward.
  * Consider adding in 1 big box mesh over connected platforms
  * Add triggers on each platform. "None" platforms turn off the big box mesh which allows the player to fall through
* Consider making levels arbitrarily wide. This could have some really cool level designs. How would the camera work?

* Potentially explore procedurally generated "chunks" for an endless level

## Research Topics
* Add background image of space / planets?
  * Done, but I don't quite understand exactly how it works.
  * Research Camera overlay
